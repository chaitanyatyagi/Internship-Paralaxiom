The names of std_lib_modules are collected from python 3.10 even though platform is being run on python 3.6
because sys.std_lib_modules is not available in the earlier verson.


The names of third party modules are obtained from requirements.txt
    For now, the hyphens in the names (-) are converted into underscores
    And the names are converted to lowercase (this may cause error/issue when there are packages with same name
     but different letters i.e. upper/lower case, (ignored for now))
